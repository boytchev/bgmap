# bgmap
Low-poly map of provinces in Bulgaria. The file `maps.js` defines
the class `Map` that returns a province or the whole country either
as a 3D mesh (i.e. `THREE.BufferGeometry` for `THREE.Mesh`) or
a 2D conrour (also `THREE.BufferGeometry` but `for THREE.Line`).

It is possible to apply rounding of borders.
